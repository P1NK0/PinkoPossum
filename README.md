### Logan M. Brown

Howdy hey, I'm a recent graduate and current IT professional. I am a proud homelab owner/operator and spend too much of my time working on IT related issues outside of work üòÖ. Outside of work and the work I make for myself at home you'll find me delving down a topic rabbit hole of some sort, enjoying some sort of Star Wars media, or relaxing with friends while playing video games.

## Current Projects
- cynt.lol, community sourced intelligence bulletin.

### More About Me
Although relatively new to programming and software design I'm a proud supporter of open-source software, as Richard Stallman said:
>‚ÄúProprietary software is an injustice. Sharing is good, and with digital technology, sharing is easy.‚Äù 

Like any good Linux user I think every year could be the year of free and open-source operating systems. As we've seen with Microsoft Windows and MacOS proprietary software results in the stagnation of development, a loss of touch with users, and walled gardens.
